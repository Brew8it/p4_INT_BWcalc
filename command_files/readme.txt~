How to push rules into the switch:
*

-- first test:
sending packet into switch and packet comes out.

-- second test:
add the header fields ingress.

-- Third test:
Clone the packet so we can see 2 packets leaving the switch.


Futher work and tests for report:
-- add another switch and run a mininet instance where each switch has its own commands file. So we can test that our calculation and clone detection can be evaluated.
-- For that to happen we have to add code to detect each switch ID. so only one detects clones and perform the calculation.
